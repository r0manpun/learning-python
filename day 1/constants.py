# we use UPPERCASE to declare 'constants' in python
# constants are those values that will never change (pi, water boiling temperature,etc.)
# python does not have anything in the language to declare a constant. It's declared like a variable;

PI = 3.14
SECONDS_IN_HOUR = 3600
DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7

# Python is a Dynamically typed language
# it doesn't have to specify it's data type before executing as it will automatically know in the run-time

a = 22
print(id(a)) # 4362988632 - memory refrance number
