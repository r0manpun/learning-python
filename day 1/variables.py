# we use variables to store the data the application is working with

# it is a label or a name for a memory location where a value is stored, which can be manipulated

miles = 10

# naming conventions for variables
# 1. variable names can contain letters a-zA-Z, digits 0-9, and underscore;
# 2. variable name can't start with a number;
# 3. Don't use special characters in variable names;
# 4. Variable names can't be reserved words;
# 5. Use snake_case for variable names and PascalCase for class names;
# 6. Don't use words that have special meanings or are already defined;

my_name = 'Roman'
age = 25
day_1= 'today'

max_value = 10 # snake_case
